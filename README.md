# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to assist Louise, an artistic fundraiser, in maximizing her fundraising goals. There is one play called _Fever_ which came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, I will perform an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals. I will identify trends and guidance on what successful practices that she should employ in the future. I will use visualizations to help with this. 

I will attempt to assist Louise by using the Kickstarter dataset. The Kickstarter dataset consisted of:
- Plays (although it had other parent categories as well)
- Financial goals, amounts pledged, and whether the goals were met or not
- Countries
- Dates
- Number of backers
- Average donated

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this, I did a pivot chart with theater in mind. It was a pivot chart showing the months with number of successful vs failed or canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this, I used the COUNIFS command which counts the number of cells in a range meeting criteria.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had challenges with getting the pictures to show, at first. Then I got them to show, but they needed to be cropped.  
I could not get a link to work, so I just showed the picture there.

## Results
**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
The months in which she should do fundraising should be May and October. She should avoid the Christmas holiday season.

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
Louise will be more successful if she asks for small amounts of money from lots of people.

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**
It does not tell the entire story. For example, it did not break down the givers: Were they individuals or organizations? If individuals, what were the demographics? If organizations, what type were they? Also, what type of fundraising campaigns were used: Were they via social media, print, TV, or something else?

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
We could see how other countries are doing, or we could explore different parent categories, such as:
-Film and video
-Music
-Photography
