# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to assist Louise, an artistic fundraiser, in maximizing her fundraising goals. There is one play called _Fever_ which came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, I will perform an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals. I will identify trends and guidance on what successful practices that she should employ in the future. 

I will attempt to assist Louise by using the Kickstarter dataset. The Kickstarter dataset consisted of:
- Plays (although it had other art forms as well)
- Financial goals, amounts pledged, and whether the goals were met or not
- Countries
- Dates
- Number of backers
- Average donated

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this, I did a pivot chart xxx

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this, I did a summary xxxx

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had challenges with getting the pictures to show, at first. Also they had too much which space on the bottom and I had to crop.

## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The months in which she should do fundraising should be the following: 
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
Louise should only do fundraising in May and October.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The categories which seem to be doing well are: 
![Outcomes Based on Goals](resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
Description of the picture and pivot
Louise will be more successful if she asks for small amounts of money from lots of people.
More successful if:
- Less than 1000
- 30,000-40,000
- 50,000 and up
COuntifs - number of cells in a range that meet a criteria

What are some limitations of this dataset?
It does not tell the entire story. For example, it did not break down the givers - were they individuals, organizations or corporations? If individuals, what were the demographics? If organizations, what type were they? Also, what type of fundraising campaigns were used - was it email, print, TV, social media, or something else?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
She could add additional graphs based on different countries or different art forms.
